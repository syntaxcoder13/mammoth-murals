# 🎨 Mammoth Murals Website

This is a **Mammoth Murals** website that I built using **HTML** and **SCSS**.  
It’s a clean, creative, and fully responsive site made without using any JavaScript.  
The design works perfectly on **mobile devices** and **desktop screens (1440px)**.

It has a bright color scheme, big fonts, and large visuals that make the site look modern and attractive.
